A roof top cafe kind of ambiance with lush green decor.\\nWe went around 3pm and ordered Mushroom Manchurian, Manchow Soup, Bol Choy & Tofu Dumpling and Wamama Special Bao. To be precise, they got authentic Pan Asian and Indo Chinese dishes as well. We loved all the dishes except Bok Choy & Tofu Dumpling, seems like it was steamed more than the actual time.

As per me, Kwality Walls is still a best along with other Ice Cream Brands. I had my first Choco Bar from Kwality Walls only. Well, The Kwality Wall's Swirls in BSK look like a flagship outlet with pretty decent interiors. I love their Strawberry, Butterscotch & Kesar Pista at any point of time. They have umbrella chairs & bean bags outside & inside. They should probably work on pricing part, since the prices are too expensive. I recommend this place!\\n\\nbangaloreepicure.com\"), ('Rated 2.5', \"RATED\\n  This place is located in a corner, off Banashankari BDA complex. Nice little place, with a pleasing ambience (with tables under an umbrella on the outside). They provide quick service too.\\n\\nNow coming to the ice creams themselves, they're quite disappointing. They do not even compare to other popular parlours like Corner House or Baskin Robbins.

Visited this place several times, penning a review today. Tulsi water served for drinking is the highlight. Paddu outer layer was nice crispy but inside was too hard and just a tasteless dough, was disappointed ordering it. My personal favourite here is pesarattu only if they serve it crispy. The next favourite is raggi mudhae with the vegetable or sprout sambar that they serve..... really yummy and filling too. Millet rawa onion dosa is yummy again only if served crispy. Found cost to be too expensive for a dinner, rs450 for two for tiffen variety. The noon lunch with millet variety rice and South Indian dishes are very filling and different but wouldn't call it yummy. Variety rice in millets needs improvement. Dessert with black rice is yummy while wheat flour just okies. Overall it is mediocre experience but calls for multiple visit cause of the traditional millet based food.\"), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  A vegetarian restaurant specialised in millet based dishes.
